# Game-Theory-Project

The goal of this project is to reproduce the results achieved in the paper *Achieving Cooperation in a Minimally Constrained Environment* by *Steven Damer* and *Maria Gini*.

To run the project, please run the *runner.py* file. The program will create an agent and play him against a stationary opponent over 1000 different games. The program will plot how well the agent managed to estimate the opponents attitude and estimate.
